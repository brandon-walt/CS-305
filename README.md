# CS-305 Software Security


- The client requesting this software is Artemis Financial. The issue they wanted addressed was protecting their organization from external threats.


- It is important to code securely because it helps reduce the risk of things such as data breaches of Artemis Financials’ sensitive business information. Adding software security brings value to a company's overall wellbeing by helping to ensure their users data is handled securely, avoiding any attacks that may also cause damage to a company’s reputation. 


- The part of the vulnerability assessment that was helpful to me was identifying vulnerabilities such as input validation and lack of encryption, which was helpful because it identified areas within the software that could be exploited. 


- I increased layers of security by implementing input validation and encrypting the sensitive data. In the future, I would use automated tools to access vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use. 
  

- One way I made certain the code and software application were functional and secure was by conducting manual code reviews and further static testing. After refactoring the code, I checked whether or not I had introduced new vulnerabilities by conducting another static test such as a dependency check. 


 - One tool I used that might be useful in future assignments or tasks is the dependency check plugin which helped identify any potential threats exposed by the code bases dependencies. 


 - One thing I might show future employers from this assignment is my ability to identify vulnerabilities within a code base through things such as manual code review and static testing.
